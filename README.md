<h1> Color Crasher - A game of wits and rainbows </h1>

Hey everyone! This is our Capstone project for the Digital Design Architecture and Verification Project at IEEE at UCLA. Our idea for this project was to integrate the concept of Asteroids into a color-based game, where users would get to play an MC who shoots colorful attacks at some enemies.

This project is composed of 4 key sections:
- I2C Integration for Wii Nunchuk operation
- VGA Operation for gameplay
- Game State Updater for MC, Bullet(Bill), and Enemy operation
- Graphics Generator for VGA Input

This project is still a work-in-progress but we are excited to launch the code!

This project is powered by systemVerilog and Intel's Quartus FPGA HDL processor.
